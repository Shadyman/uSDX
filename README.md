This project is a fork of Guido's [QCX-SSB](https://github.com/threeme3/QCX-SSB).
You can participate in ongoing discussion at the [uSDX forum](https://groups.io/g/ucx).

Goals of this particular build:
- Light enough for backpacking (5oz without batteries, 12oz with batteries)
- Effeciency for extended operation on battery power
- High-quality SSB audio
- Compatible with 3.5mm TRRS phone audio cable, for running digital modes on a phone or small laptop
- Inexpensive hardware - under $50 including PCB
- Reasonably solderable at home
