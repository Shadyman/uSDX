This folder is for ngspice simulations (using KiCad, of course)
My initial attempt to build the simulations directly into amp.sch proved very confusion, since there were now two KiCad projects referencing the same file. So instead we have two versions of the power amplifier: One intended for simulation, and one for production.

Feel free to play around with the values to get better effeciency and power output. And if you manage to graph instantaneous power dumped by the transistor, please let me know how.
